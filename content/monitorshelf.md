I noticed that the desktop monitors at my workstation were too low, causing me to hunch over. I used [ergotron.com's workspace planner](https://www.ergotron.com/en-us/tools/workspace-planner) to determine the optimal shelf height based on the heights of myself, the chair, and the desk.

The wood was mounted to a sawhorse and cut to size using a circular saw.

Using a drill press, I drilled a large (1" diameter) hole in the back to pass cables through for clean cable management.

The room underneath acts as extra storage space.

The 1x4 in the back lends structural support to prevent the top piece from flexing under the weight of the monitors. It is attached to the legs with screws.

I then drilled holes into the wood to drive in the screws used to hold the legs in place using these corner braces.
